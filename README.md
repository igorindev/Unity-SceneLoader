# Scene Loader Tool for Unity
Opens a scrollable window containing a list of Scenes (assigned by the user) that allows to easily load these Scenes (single or additive) without the need to search them in the project window. If there is a not saved scene, a DisplayBlock will be shown asking to save the scene before removing it.

## How to Use
- A SceneLoaderGroup asset holds the Scenes and Icons, and it is already created. If needed, go to Create/Scene Loader/Scene Group to create a new one.
- Add scenes to the list by clicking on the ⚙️ (gear) icon.
- Open the menu and click on the Scenes buttons to load them.

(2021+) The Scene Loader needs to be set as visible in the overlay window and placed where the user wants. 

(2020-) The Scene Loader can be accessed in the top left corner of the SceneView.

## How to Install
Download this repository and import the Package or the Folder to inside your Unity project.
